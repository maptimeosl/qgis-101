Intro to QGIS: Make a Map

The task for this exercise it to make a map of transit stops in Oslo.
The goal is learn how to use the features of QGIS Desktop, including adding data, projecting, running some
basic geoprocessing, and using the print composer.

1. Open up a new QGIS Project.

2. Add the following two layers:
	Oslo Bydeler
	Bus, tram stops 

	Find them on http://maptimeosl.github.io/qgis-101/data/dataosl.zip"

	Unzip to access datasets.

4. Enable On-The-Fly Projections

5. Symbolize your Data!
	Right click and go to Properties -> Style
	Play with the Settings

6. Basic Geoprocessing
	Try a few geoprocessing tasks
		Perhaps Buffer around Bus stops
		Or use Point in Polygon to determine Bust stops by Bydel

7. Add basemap layers
	Use the Open Layers Plugin and add an OpenStreetMaps basemap!

7. Compose your Map
	Using the Print Composer!
	Add a Legend, Scale Bar, Data Sources, etc.

8. Export and Save

Some ideas to try:
	Make a map of the neighborhoods with the highest number of transit stops
	Map all areas near a transist stop
	Map transit stops by type
	Or find some other data, add it, and combine!
